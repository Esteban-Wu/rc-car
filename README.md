# rc-car
Repo for an RC car utilizing Arduino-compatible nRf24L01 transceiver modules.

The "transmitter" file should be uploaded to the Arduino acting as the remote, and the "motor-receiver" file should be uploaded to the Arduino controlling the motors. "rc-car.ai" is an Adobe Illustrator file containing the blueprints for a basic controller and car that can be printed with a laser printer.

Notable hardware: 
2x Arduino Uno
2x DC motor
2x nRF24L01 module
L9110 motor controller
